   I started my career as a Mobile App developer using React Native, and I've cherished every step of this journey. Learning has been a continuous process for me, and still learning. I'm passionate about exploring new technologies, reading, travelling to new places, and staying active through sports.

  If you need me, you'll probably find me toggling between lines of code and lines on a map.
