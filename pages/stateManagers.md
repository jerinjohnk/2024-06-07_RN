# Redux toolkit

<div>

This includes store setup, creating reducers and writing immutable update logic, and even creating entire `slices` of state at once.

```shell
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
npm install redux
```

<br>

> Zustand and Jotai are a great alternative to redux to reduce boilerplate code.

<br>

# Async Storage

To store string data locally on device.

```shell
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage

```
