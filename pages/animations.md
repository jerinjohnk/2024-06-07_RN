# Animations

<div>

React Native provides two complementary animation systems: `Animated` for granular and interactive control of specific values, and `LayoutAnimation` for animated global layout transactions.
<br>
<br>

## Animated API

`Animated` focuses on declarative relationships between inputs and outputs, with configurable transforms in between, and `start`/`stop` methods to control time-based animation execution.
<br>
<br>

## LayoutAnimation API

`LayoutAnimation` allows you to globally configure `create` and `update` animations that will be used for all views in the next render/layout cycle.
<br>
<br>

</div>

> With react-native-reanimated, you can easily create smooth animations and interactions that run on the UI thread.
